Server-Side Web Development
Working in a group of 3 people you will plan, design, and created a dynamic PHP web application with a MySQL backend containing the following features:
C.R.U.D. pages, user access control using sessions, dynamic navigation bars, CSS and modular code design.
Build a web application for a Fitness Centre (pick a name). The website will have 3 user levels:
- Public
- Member
- Admin
You can build the public pages, then the member pages, then the admin pages.

Web Application requirements:
- Handle form data in a secure manner e.g. use HTML and PHP validation techniques when handling user inputs.
- Make the website look professional by using good CSS techniques (frameworks) and appropriate content.
- Your HTML, CSS, and PHP code should be original and commented. You may be asked to explain any piece of code. Failure to understand and explain code may be taken as evidence of plagiarism. You may use frameworks such as bootstrap. All HTML and CSS should be validated.
- PHP code should be modular e.g. include header and footer files as opposed to copying and pasting the same code to several pages.
- The home page of the site should be called index.php
- Your website should follow best practice in terms of security.
- Store its data in a MySQL database.
- Connection to the database should be made using one file (e.g. connect.php).
- Database table names should be singular e.g. user not users.
